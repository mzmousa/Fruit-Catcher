Written in Java using the JCreator IDE.

### How to Run
Since I first implemented this as an applet, rather than a GUI, running this smoothly is a bit troublesome. Until I implement this on my personal website, you must:  
1. Clone this project in your local directory.  
2. Open `StartingPoint.jcw` in JCreator (download [here](http://www.jcreator.org/download.htm)).  
3. Run the project.

### How to Play
Set your starting energy at the beginning of the game, depending on how challenging you want it to be (10%-100%).
Navigate left and right using arrow the arrow keys.

### To do
* Implement in a GUI rather than an Applet, so running it is isn't as troublesome
* Add gameplay video / GIF
* Implement on personal website
* Character selection
* Animated sprites
* High scores / Leaderboard
